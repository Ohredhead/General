## [[Emission-Free Metal Industry]]

**Summary**  
The hydrogen plasma approach offers a pathway toward a **carbon-free future** for heavy industry, especially in the production of metals like steel and ferromanganese.

**Key Points**  
- Traditional metal production is highly carbon-intensive.  
- Technologies like hydrogen plasma enable a **shift to electricity and hydrogen** instead of fossil fuels.  
- A major step in meeting global **climate targets**.
