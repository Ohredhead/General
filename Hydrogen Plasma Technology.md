## [[Hydrogen Plasma Technology]]

**Summary**  
Researchers at [[SINTEF Research Organization]] have developed a method to use **hydrogen plasma** instead of fossil carbon in metal production, which could eliminate CO₂ emissions from processes like steel and [[Ferromanganese Production]].

**Key Points**  
- Hydrogen plasma is created by heating hydrogen gas to extremely high temperatures, forming a highly reactive state.  
- This reactive hydrogen can **strip oxygen from metal ores** more efficiently than conventional hydrogen or carbon-based methods.  
- The process emits **only water vapor**, unlike traditional methods that emit CO₂.  
- It’s a potential solution for the **green transition** of the metal industry.
