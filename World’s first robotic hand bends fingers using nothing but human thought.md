## World’s first robotic hand bends fingers using nothing but human thought

**Summary**  
Researchers at [[Carnegie Mellon]] University, led by [[Dr. Bin He]], have developed a non-invasive [[BCI]] that enables users to control external devices such as prosthetics, robot limbs, and drones. Using [[deep learning]] the team translate [[EEG]] signals into thought -driven control at the levels individual fingers.
In contrast to invasive procedures, non-invasive [[BCI]] require no surgery nor maintenance. This provides substantial benefits over the invasive type if the same level of precision can be achieved. The article does not make clear if that is yet possible.

**Key Points**  
- Non-invasive [[BCI]] to control external devices
- [[Deep learning]] used to interpret [[EEG]] signals
