Â [Nicolas Holzschuchâ€™s](https://github.com/holzschu)Â Â _[_a-Shell_](https://holzschu.github.io/a-Shell_iOS/)_Â app.Â _a-Shell_Â gives you a Unix-style terminal on your iPad or iPhone and itâ€™s completely free.

Once you install and openÂ _a-Shell_, typeÂ `help`Â to get a quick overview of the app:

_a-Shell_Â comes withÂ `vim`Â andÂ `ed`Â for editing files, and it includes Python 3.9 out-of-the box. Hereâ€™s what editing a Python file inÂ `vim`Â looks like:

**Tip:**Â If you use Appleâ€™s Magic Keyboard for iPad, then you donâ€™t have a physicalÂ `Esc`Â key. This makes working in vim painful until you figure out thatÂ `Cmd + .`Â works likeÂ `Esc`. If you'd like, you can changeÂ `Caps Lock`to work asÂ `Esc`Â inÂ _a-Shell_â€™s settings.  
  
You can also map the globe key on the Magic Keyboard to function asÂ `Esc`Â in the Settings app.

_a-Shell_Â plays nicely with iPadOS 15â€™s multi-tasking features. You can open new windows, putÂ _a-Shell_Â side-by-side with another app, and â€” my favorite â€” useÂ _a-Shell_Â in slideover mode.

I do a lot of reading on my iPad. When I come across something that I want to check in the Python REPL, itâ€™s incredibly helpful to be able to swipe in from the right-hand-side of my iPad, quickly check something in the REPL, and then dismiss the app by swiping right:

You can install Python packages usingÂ `pip`Â inÂ _a-Shell_Â as long as those package are pure Python. This is admittedly a serious limitation for a lot of folks, but it does allow you to install some pretty awesome packages â€” includingÂ [Will McGuganâ€™s](https://twitter.com/willmcgugan)Â awesomeÂ [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)Â library:

Besides being a great way to use Python on your iPad,Â _a-Shell_Â has a lot of other useful features. You can navigate your iPadâ€™s file system, transfer files usingÂ `curl`, generate SSH keys, SSH into remote servers, and more. You can even write programs in C and C++ andÂ _run them on your iPad_Â ðŸ¤¯

One ofÂ _a-Shell_â€™s major downsides is the lack of support for Python virtual environments. This meansÂ _a-Shell_Â is great for testing things out, or for doing some basic, pure-Python programming, but itâ€™s not very well suited to professional development.
