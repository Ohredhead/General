Nexus:
Premise: we well know the risks of building things beyond our control → however he wrongly assume that, that power comes from an individual. it comes from the collective → jump to the mandate to abuse said power also coming from the collective → so the author assets that, "The main argument of this book is that humankind gains enormous power by building large networks of cooperation, but the way these networks are built predisposes them to use power unwisely. Our problem, then, is a network problem."

"…powerful networks, held together by exceptionally deluded ideas."

THE NAIVE VIEW OF INFORMATION
Optimistic view of large-scale human networks → big networks achieve a beter understanding
"Information → truth → wisdom and power"
"In most cases most information news greater accuracy.”
Note: " in a free market of information sooner or later truth will prevail.” <- capitalist foundational idea. How perfect does information need to be for this to hold 
Note: "information is an essentially good thing, and the more we have of it, the better." ← is that the case? One should consider access to information or processing of information.

"GOOGLE VERSUS GOETHE"
 one person night use access to information irresponsibly but may people will create much and use it wisely.
 Noah illustrates the concept with the decrease of child/early mortality due to discovery of medical information. <- example of controlled information growth?
 Noah hints that the increase in information might also be the cause of our current existential crises

 two AI dangers:
 "AI could supercharge existing human conflicts"
 "Silicon Curtain might come to divide… all humans from our new AI overlords"
 No evidence yet offered for these two dangers just that "experts" warn
 note: AI is the first technology in history that can make decisions and create new ideas by itself ← is it the first to make decisions? Do algorithms prior not? Also does it create truly new ideas? Or are they largely mix and match? Think paper from sonnet team about how LLMs can not truly think or abstract.
