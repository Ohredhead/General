## [[Carbon Capture Reimagined New Material Removes CO2 From Air Like a Tree]]

**Summary**  
Researchers at ETH Zurich have developed a new synthetic material that mimics the way trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. By embedding Cyanobacteria into hydrogel the material stores CO2 as biomass and minerals. Over 400 days about 26 milligrams of CO2 are bound per milligram of material. The mineral deposition also helps harden the hydrogel. The structures can be originally shaded using [[3D printing]].

**Key Points**  
- The material uses [[cyanobacteria]] in [[hydrogel]] to store CO2 as biomass and minerals. About 26 mg of CO2 per 1 mg of material
- Capture of CO2 as minerals is a pretty unique feature of cyanobacteria
- The material could enable future low-energy carbon capture technologies at scale.
