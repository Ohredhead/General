## [[Ultrafast Charge Transfer in Nanoscale Trilayer Semiconductors]]

**Summary**  
Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have demonstrated that a trilayer structure composed of molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and tungsten diselenide (WSe₂) enables a directional charge transfer cascade. This structure significantly improves charge separation efficiency, showing promise for future solar and optoelectronic technologies.  

**Key Points**  
- The trilayer design mimics natural charge transfer cascades by directing electrons and holes through different layers.  
- The structure achieves a longer charge separation lifetime and enhanced carrier yield compared to bilayer configurations.  
- The findings could lead to improved performance in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.
