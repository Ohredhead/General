## [[HyPla Project]]

**Summary**  
The HyPla (Hydrogen Plasma) project is SINTEFâ€™s dedicated research initiative aimed at using **electricity and [[hydrogen]]** to reduce manganese ore without carbon emissions.

**Key Points**  
- Combines theoretical modeling, lab experiments, and **pilot-scale tests**.  
- Successfully demonstrated **reduction of manganese ore** using hydrogen plasma.  
- Aims to scale the method for industrial use
